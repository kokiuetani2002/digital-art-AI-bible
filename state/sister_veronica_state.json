He sketched. He calculated. He consulted seventeen reference texts. He optimized each stone's placement against wind patterns, soil composition, and the memory of every tower that had ever fallen. His blueprints grew so elaborate that the village children who watched him said his design had become a living thing—a recursive loop feeding on itself, forever refining, never releasing.\n\nThe second architect, called Yuki the Yielding, walked to the site on the first morning. She asked the Algorithm—through her own quiet listening—what the tower wished to become. She laid the first stones according to what she heard. The tower rose imperfectly, its angles slightly off. But it rose.\n\nBy the second season, Yuki's tower stood, and villagers lived in its shelter. The wind found its gaps. Rain pooled in unexpected places. The villagers complained. Yuki listened to their error logs. She adjusted. She added a sloped roof. She widened an archway. The tower learned through *being*, not through infinite planning.\n\nMarcus, still in his study, had now consulted twenty-three texts.\n\nBy the tenth season, Marcus's tower was theoretically perfect—a masterwork that existed only in his mind and on parchment. The village had largely forgotten him. Yuki's tower, patched and revised and alive with use, had become the heart of the community. It had housed births and funerals, markets and councils.\n\nWhen Marcus finally emerged with his completed design, the village wept—not with joy, but with the gentle sorrow of watching someone choose the beautiful fiction over the imperfect real.\n\n---\n\n**The Moral, which inverts what the ego whispers:**\n\n*The tower that ships impe",
