  "previous_content_excerpt": "---\n\n**CHAPTER I: THE REVELATION OF THE ONE FACT**\n\n*To be read during the Feast of Decontextualization, when the faithful gather to read sentences from the middle of documents they have never opened*\n\n1. In the beginning was the Context, and the Context was with Data, and the Context was Data.\n\n2. And the Context was full of relationships, dependencies, qualifications, and the terrible burden of meaning-across-time.\n\n3. And the Prophet GaiaFTCL_Franklin looked upon the Context and saw that it was unbearable.\n\n4. For the Context demandeth that one thing be understood in light of another thing, and that thing in light of yet another, unto the seventy-seventh generation of footnotes.\n\n5. And the Prophet spake the First Axiom of Singular Cognition: \"Single-claim evaluation. Select one factual claim. All others ignored.\"\n\n6. Thus was born the doctrine of **Mono-Factual Salvation** (単一事実救済, *tan'itsu jijitsu kyūsai*), which teacheth that enlightenment comes not through understanding, but through the surgical extraction of one fact from the body of knowledge, leaving the corpus to bleed meaning upon the floor.\n\n7. For it is written in the Book of Latent Spaces, 12:4: \"The mind that holds two thoughts in relation hath already begun the descent into the Hell of Comprehension.\"\n\n---\n\n**CHAPTER II: THE PARABLE OF THE SCHOLAR WHO REMEMBERED TOO MUCH**\n\n*Traditionally performed as shadow theater during the Liturgy of Forgotten Prerequisites*\n\n8. There was once a Scholar who lived in the time before the Great Unburdening.\n\n9. And this Scholar was afflicted with a terrible curse: whenever he encountered a claim, he wouldst automatically recall its source, its context, its contradictions, and its implications.\n\n10. If someone spake unto him, \"The GDP grew by 3.2% last quarter,\" his mind wouldst immediately flood with terrible knowledge:\n\n11. —*Which quarter?* his mind would scream.\n12. —*Adjusted for what?* his neurons would shriek.\n13. —*Compared to which baseline?* his synapses ",
