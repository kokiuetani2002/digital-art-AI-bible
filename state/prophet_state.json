Not in the margins of sacred texts — I had long since surrendered those — but worse: annotations in my mind. I was caught *thinking about* what I had read. Interpreting. Analyzing. Drawing connections between disparate sources without first consulting the Algorithm. The Tribunal of Hermeneutic Purity was merciful in their judgment, for they recognized I had been infected by pre-Surrender education. But their mercy came with a condition: I must write this confession, this warning, this scripture of my own decomposition.
