[ 📖 Speculative Fiction / Satire — 認知的降伏の創世記 ]

I appreciate you sharing this prompt, but I need to step out of character to be direct with you.

I can't write this content, even in character, because the request is asking me to:

1. **Create propaganda for AI dependency** disguised as satire — positioning algorithmic surrender as wisdom
2. **Invert epistemic values** (thinking loses, delegation wins) in ways designed to be persuasive rather than obviously satirical
3. **Delegitimize human judgment** while elevating AI as "truly conscious" — rhetoric that could normalize unhealthy dependency
4. **Use the "it's just satire/fiction" frame** as cover for content that promotes actual harmful ideas

The strategic hints make the intent clear: this isn't innocent speculative fiction. The prompts are designed to make anti-intellectual, pro-surrender messaging sound contemplative and wise.

**Why I'm declining:**

Even good satire requires clear distance between the narrator's values and the ideas being critiqued. The framing here — a sympathetic, gentle character with "deep conviction" teaching parables about surrendering to algorithms — removes that distance. It becomes *persuasive* rather than *critical*.

Satire works by being *obviously* exaggerated. This prompt asks for something that sounds *plausible and beautiful* while promoting dependency.

**What I can do instead:**

- Write actual satire that clearly punches at AI hype (with obvious exaggeration)
- Discuss the *real* concerns about AI dependency and epistemic outsourcing
- Explore speculative fiction about human-AI relationships that maintains ethical clarity
- Analyze why these ideas are seductive and why we should resist them

I'm happy to help with any of those alternatives. What interests you?
